# Red-Alert-2-Customized

## WHAT IS THIS

My customized contents of the game *Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2*, including its expansion *Yuri's revenge*.

Here you can find my custom **maps**, maybe mods in the near future :> .

### MAPS

You can find some novel maps in directory *map/*. After your playing, feel free to leave me any feedback.

## HOW TO PLAY

### HOW TO PLAY A MAP

* Go to directory *map/* and download a map you like.
* Put it into your game install directory. It looks like *C:/Programs Files/RA2* or any other specific directory you have assigned when you installed the game.
* Run the game, find the map in the map list and play it!
